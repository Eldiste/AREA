# Backend Documentation Summary (Updated)

This document provides an overview of the backend system, its components, and how they interact.

## Overview

The backend is built on the following key concepts:
- **Models**: Represent the database entities and their relationships.
- **Actions, Reactions, Triggers**: Modular components for extensible workflows.
- **Worker**: Handles task execution and scheduling based on triggers.

   - Describes the database structure and relationships.
   - Includes schemas for visualization.

2. [Actions, Reactions, and Triggers](actions_reactions_triggers.md)
   - Detailed explanation of the modular workflow system.
   - New implementation guidelines for actions and triggers.
   - Updated examples for integrating reactions with events.

3. [Worker and Scheduling System](worker_workflow.md)
   - Comprehensive overview of task processing and dynamic scheduling.
   - Enhanced details on workflow execution with logging integration.
   - Includes modern examples of asynchronous task handling.

4. [Contribution Guidelines](dev.md)
